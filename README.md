# Spectral diffusion for Landlab

The code here implements a spectral method for linear hillslope diffusion and
applies it to a few landscape evolution cases in Landlab. The base
functions can also be applied to calculate diffusion of any variable of interest
on a raster grid. Theoretical description of the methods used can be found
in the numerical background file. Scripts are included to create the figures
presented in the included poster, presented at the CSDMS meeting in May 2019:

The code is supplied as-is with no guarantees of maintenance or functionality.
